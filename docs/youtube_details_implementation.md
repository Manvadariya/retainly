# YouTube Details Page Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a dedicated YouTube video details page that displays all stored metadata for YouTube videos. When a user taps on a YouTube card in the grid or list view, they are taken to this specialized page instead of the generic card detail screen.

## New Components

### 1. YouTubeDetailsScreen
A dedicated screen for displaying YouTube metadata with the following sections:
- Full-width thumbnail with 16:9 aspect ratio
- Title and publish date information
- Expandable description section
- Tags displayed as chips in a wrap layout
- Video ID as selectable text
- "Open in YouTube" button that launches the video in a browser or the YouTube app

### 2. YouTubeCardHelper
A utility class that:
- Identifies YouTube cards in the card collection
- Extracts YouTubeMetadata from card entities
- Provides consistent handling of YouTube cards across the app

## Integration Points

### 1. SpaceScreen
Updated the card selection handler to check if the card is a YouTube video. If so, it extracts the metadata and navigates to the YouTubeDetailsScreen.

### 2. MainGridView
Similarly updated to check for YouTube cards and navigate to the YouTube details page when appropriate.

### 3. CardGrid
Modified the card selection logic to support YouTube cards while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing card selection mechanism.

## Features

### Display
- Uses CachedNetworkImage for efficient thumbnail loading with placeholder and error handling
- Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio for thumbnails
- Shows video title, publish date, and description
- Displays tags as chips in a wrap layout for easy readability
- Shows video ID with copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Interaction
- Description can be expanded/collapsed for long descriptions
- Tags displayed in a wrap layout
- "Open in YouTube" button to watch the video
- Share button to share the video URL
- Copy button for the video ID

### Design
- Follows the app's theme (dark/light mode)
- Card-like sections with padding and rounded corners
- Visual separation between sections
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

## Performance Considerations
- No additional network fetches - uses only the metadata already stored in the card
- CachedNetworkImage for efficient thumbnail loading
- Lazy loading of expandable content
- Minimal use of heavy widgets

## Testing
- Code analysis shows no critical issues
- All features are implemented according to requirements
- Backwards compatible with existing cards

## Future Improvements
- Add caching for YouTube thumbnails
- Implement video playback directly in the app
- Add more metadata like view count and channel information if available
